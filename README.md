# Description

Hey :wave: welcome to my repository.

Here I will sharing my networking projects which will be focusing on network security and functionality. These project are will be conducted using Cisco Packet Tracer and will cover numerous networking topics, providing a comprehensive simulation environment for exploring networking concepts and protocols. 


# Installation

To run these project files Cisco Packet Tracer must be installed, it can be installed from the official Cisco Networking Academy page using this link https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer. Once Packet Tracer has been installed, download the desired project .pkt file and open it on Packet Tracer, then explore the project.

I will be providing fully configured files and detailed descriptions of the protocols used for each project. Some of these projects will include devices that have password potection, as such passwords for those devices will be provided.
