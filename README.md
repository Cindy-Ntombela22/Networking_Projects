# Description

Hey :wave: welcome to my repository.

Here I will sharing my networking projects which will be focusing on network security and functionality. These project are will be conducted using Cisco Packet Tracer and will cover numerous networking topics, providing a comprehensive simulation environment for exploring networking concepts and protocols. 


# Installation

To run these project files Cisco Packet Tracer must be installed, it can be installed from the official Cisco Networking Academy page using this link https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads?courseLang=en-US. Once Packet Tracer has been installed, download the desired project .pkt file and open it on Packet Tracer, then explore the project.

I will be providing fully configured files and detailed descriptions of the protocols used for each project. Some of these projects will include devices that have password potection, thus passwords for those devices will be provided.     


# Projects

Project 1 - Remote Connectivety Project:
This project focuses on designing and configuring a network consisting of a main and branch office with the intention of improving connectivity and network performance between the offices, as well as providing secure private communication between them through the use of IPsec VPN, use of OSPF to ensure optimal data path selection, DHCP for IP addressing, as well as Inter-VLAN routing for communication between devices in different VLANs. 


Project 2 - Campus Connectivity Project: 
Designed and configured a campus network with the intention of providing secure private communication between its branches while ensuring fast connectivity and protection of the network. The topology of this project consisted of a DMZ for shared resources between the campuses, firewalls and passwords for the protection and security of the networks; SSH, IPsec VPN were used for this purpose as well; and wireless and wired end user devices. Protocols such as OSPF, DHCP, HRSP for network redundancy, STP, PortFast, BPDU Guard, ACLs, EtherChannel and Inter-VLAN routing were also configured.


Project 3 - Capstone Project:
Designed and configured a campus network with the intention of providing redundant connectivity between its three branches. The first branch consisted of a three-tier hierarchical design with the other branches having a collapsed core design. The branches were configured with OSPF, DHCP, STP, EtherChannel, Inter-VLAN routing and PAT between the intranet and the internet. A wireless LAN controller was configured for wireless device connectivity. SSH was configured for secure remote access.
